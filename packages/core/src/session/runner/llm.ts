/**
 * Runs one durable coding-agent Session until it settles.
 *
 * Keep this as orchestration over smaller collaborators rather than rebuilding the legacy
 * `SessionPrompt` monolith. Implement the unchecked items in small reviewed slices:
 *
 * - Session ownership and controls
 *   - [x] Coordinate one local active drain per Session; explicit resumes join and prompt wakeups coalesce.
 *   - [ ] Replace local ownership with durable multi-node ownership when clustered.
 *   - [ ] Mark busy, retrying, idle, interrupted, or terminal-failure status durably.
 *   - [ ] Honor interruption and reject stale work after runtime attachment replacement.
 *   - [x] Bound model steps.
 *   - [ ] Bound provider retries and repeated identical tool calls.
 *
 * - Runtime context assembly
 *   - Track V1 runtime-context parity canonically in `specs/v2/session.md`.
 *
 * - One provider turn
 *   - [x] Translate every projected V2 Session message variant into canonical
 *     `@opencode-ai/llm` messages.
 *   - [ ] Resolve policy-filtered built-in, MCP, plugin, and structured-output tool definitions.
 *   - [x] Stream exactly one `llm.stream(request)` provider turn.
 *   - [x] Persist assistant text and usage events incrementally as they arrive.
 *   - [ ] Persist snapshots, patches, and retry notices incrementally as they arrive.
 *   - [x] Persist reasoning, provider errors, and tool-call events incrementally as they arrive.
 *
 * - Tool settlement and continuation
 *   - [x] Durably record each tool call before side effects begin.
 *   - [x] Authorize and execute recorded local calls through a core-owned registry hook.
 *   - [x] Persist typed success, failure, and provider-executed tool outcomes.
 *   - [x] Start each recorded local call eagerly and await all settlements before continuation.
 *   - [ ] Add scoped runtime context, progress updates, attachment normalization,
 *     plugins, and cancellation settlement.
 *   - [x] Reload projected history and start the next explicit provider turn after local tool results.
 *   - [x] Continue for durable user steering accepted during an active provider turn.
 *   - [ ] Continue for compaction or another continuation condition when required.
 *
 * - Post-run maintenance
 *   - [ ] Settle final status and expose durable output events to replayable consumers.
 *   - [ ] Coalesce streamed deltas and add covering projected-history indexes.
 *   - [ ] Update title, summaries, compaction state, and cleanup in bounded background work.
 *
 * `RunTurn` owns provider-turn preparation, streaming, tool settlement, and continuation signals.
 * This module owns durable activity scheduling and bounded continuation. Durable activity recovery
 * remains a separate future slice with an explicit retry policy.
 *
 * The current slice loads V2 history, translates it, resolves a model through a core service, and persists one
 * provider turn. Registry definitions are advertised, local tool calls are settled durably, and a
 * bounded explicit loop starts the next provider turn after local settlement.
